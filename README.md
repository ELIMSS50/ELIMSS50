## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate with hands-on experience in **data analysis, backend development, and system-level programming**.

My work focuses on **Python-based data processing**, backend logic, and building scalable and maintainable systems. I enjoy working close to how systems behave under real constraints, from database schemas to infrastructure and automation.

Currently, I am expanding a **production-oriented Python system** with a more solid backend architecture, an intuitive frontend, and extended data analysis logic to support multiple schemas and complex comparison cases.
